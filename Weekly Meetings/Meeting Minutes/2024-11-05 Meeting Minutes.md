**Nov 5 Meeting Minutes:**


**Merging issue **
- Reads for FMT paper (4) is too small, so we will need to check the table for just the FMT paper
- Looked at FMT demux file 
- Something went wrong with the denoising of the FMT→ 41 samples and only 989 reads 
- Redo from denoising step and then do merging of Mintz and halverson
- Trim Mintz at 220 forward and 220 reverse when denoising again → if it takes longer than  a day cut it → do a detached screen and check every few hours 
- Code seems to be fine, but we should rerun the mintz denoising as this seems to be where the issue came from 
- Try and get the diversity metrics as soon as possible 

**References **
- Use a references program for manuscript so we don't have to keep making changes 

**Things to do **
- Relabel to make files more clear 
- Rerun from demux and denoise again mintz (p4) 
- Finish references for resubmission of proposal 
- Organize Github more→ go through and make sure we have all files and that they are well labeled 

**NOTE: no meeting next week**
