Meeting minute 

Sid portion
Alpha diversity 
- Fmt profile closer to healthy 
- Figure 1 three panels → observed (a), shannon (b) , faiths pd ©
- Remove treatment and make sure labels are consistent with all other graphs 
- Colours code bars to match papers and keep control 
- Surgery appears to deplete abundance 
Beta diversity 
- Take out shape channel → add ellipses are all 
- Include in supplemental → beta diversity (bray curtis) 
- Taxa bar plots 
- Surgery→ widely differ → lots of proteobacteria 
- Squish into one taxa bar plot 
- If we are able to squish samples together, this will be figure two 

Victoria 
- Figure 3 core microbiome→ figure 3 with two panels 
- Prevalence = 0.1 
- Detection = 0.001 
- Use -- surg long, surg short, no surg and the one with fmt long, fmt short, fmt no surg 
- Comparing  against own controls 
- Surgery doesnt really drive much unique species, but fmt does 

Alex 
- Indictor species 
- Species level -- only that had value above 0.8 was phage 
- Only really indicator species associated with no fmt ibd 
- Ibd is primarily the drive of differences in the microbiomes 
- Fmt rediversifies the population 
- Look to See if the fmt are considered commensal or beneficial bacteria 
- Table one: ISA species level 
- Change indicator value to two decimal places and put treatment value as first column 
- Do it in excel 

Georgia 
- Dseq 
- Smt-short vs no fmt → shows length doesnt matter really
- Surg long vs no surg 
- Immediate resection depletes microbiome and over time it recovers 
- Short vs no surg depletes 
- Over time we are seeing a recovery 
- Make this into a table → really only comparing things whiting own paper, but keep all of them in the same table 
- Look at picture taken by georgia or victoria to see which ones to include → should be ten to include 

manucript figures 
- Figure 1 three panels → observed shannon faith pd
- Supplemental fig beta
- Fig 2 taxa bar (squished)
- Fig 3 core microbiome → prevalence  0.1, dependence = 0.001
- Table 1 indicator species 
- Table 2 deseq with o comparisons 


Next week: 
Do teaching assessment 
Meeting on Monday at 2
