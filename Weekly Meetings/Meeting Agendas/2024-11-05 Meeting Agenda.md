**November 5, 2024 Meeting Agenda**

1. Troubleshooting merge:
- Our sampling depth options are extremely low, but the rarefaction curve looks fine.
- Discuss how to fix merge and divide up this work
  
2. Confirm proposal changes, and ensure all comments have been addressed: everyone read over the changes
- After confirming changes, everyone will complete fixes to references in their section tonight
  
3. Distribute analyses between each member to be done by the next meeting
- Reconfirm which analyses we want to do and plan out completion of these
