**November 19, 2024 Meeting Minutes** 

Meeting minutes:

**Denoising Issues/Results**
Issues with denoising are now worked out
Results 
- Looked at faith_pd → fmt shows less diversity then IBD no surgery
- Ibd reduced diversity
- Weighted unifrac: IBD surg clustered together → FMT clustered with healthy → surgery was more drastic so this makes sense
- FMT gives more of a profile that is closer to the healthy individuals
- Unweighted unifrac: healthy IBD no fmt was significantly dif, with no surgery also significantly different
- Abundance does not appear to matter much
- Same patterns as weight unifrac → good!
- Alpha diversity not super exciting but beta diversity is
- evenness → healthy is sig dif from surgery
- Fmt has profile that is closer to healthy
- Surgery appears to go backwards → resections show a loss in diversity
- Fmt restores diversity (directly building flora to be similar to healthy), but surgery reduces diversity giving you chance to rebuild flora on own
- Consistent results
- Proof of concept we outlined in our research, but this comparison has likely not been done before→ we had never seen how drastic it was when compared to same control 

**To do this week**
- Individuals analysis→ 5→ diversity, indicator species, core microbiome, deseq→ one person will also build the phyloseq
- Each one of us will do one
- Lester: phyloseq object
- Sid: recreate diversity metric
- Alex: indicator species
- Victoria: core microbiome
- Deseq: Georgia 
R will give us a nicer figure for the manuscript 
Everyone have their analysis done and we will look at all of them and see which ones to include in manuscript
