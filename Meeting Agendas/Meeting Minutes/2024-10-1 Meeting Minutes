**Project Aims**

Aim 1: data wrangling, combining metadata, creating a new column

Aim 2: cross compare across the 6 groups, with indicator, differential abundance, core microbiome, diversity metrics, etc. (5 analysis)

(Aim 3?): Potentially look at functional differences, given sufficient time & data

**Work to do this week:**
Wrangle data:
- Tabulate differences between the data, what variable regions, sample size, etc.
- Decide if we want to combine before or after importing
- Create a new metadata table
- Treatment group needs to be common between the two
- Treatment column and treatment detailed
- Origin column (halfverson, FMT)

**P1 Metadata**
- Host_disease includes CD, UC, or n/a (donor)
- Column "Origin" = the dataset the data is from
