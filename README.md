# MICB475_24W1_Team_2

**Oct 1 Agenda** 
1. Review collected datasets 
2. Planning action items for the week

Potential Papers:
1 or 4

Aim 1: data wrangling, combining metadata, creating a new column

Aim 2: taxonomic metrics, core microbiome
- Surgery vs old, FMT vs young

Aim 3: cross compare

*Potentially look at functional differences

**To do**:
Wrangle data this week:
- Tabulate differences between the data, what variable regions, sample size, etc.
- Decide if we want to combine before or after importing
- Create a new metadata table
- Treatment group needs to be common between the two
- Treatment column and treatment detailed
- Origin column (halfverson, FMT)

**P1 Metadata**
- Host_disease includes CD, UC, or n/a (donor)
- Column "Origin" = the dataset the data is from 


**Oct 8 Agenda** 
1. Review differences between the data: discuss potential concerns about sample size (Georgia)
3. Updates on data wrangling
4. Planning action items for the week: demultiplexing data, denoising, clustering, etc.
*Figure out how to distribute tasks
