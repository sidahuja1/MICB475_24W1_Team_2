# MICB475_24W1_Team_2

**Oct 1 Agenda** 
1. Review collected datasets 
2. Planning action items for the week

Potential Papers:
1 or 4

Aim 1: data wrangling, combining metadata, creating a new column

Aim 2: cross compare across the 6 groups, with indicator, differential abundance, core microbiome, diversity metrics, etc. (5 analysis)

*Potentially look at functional differences


**To do**:
Wrangle data this week:
- Tabulate differences between the data, what variable regions, sample size, etc.
- Decide if we want to combine before or after importing
- Create a new metadata table
- Treatment group needs to be common between the two
- Treatment column and treatment detailed
- Origin column (halfverson, FMT)

**P1 Metadata**
- Host_disease includes CD, UC, or n/a (donor)
- Column "Origin" = the dataset the data is from 


**Oct 8 Agenda** 
1. Review differences between the data: discuss potential concerns about sample size (Georgia)
3. Updates on data wrangling
4. Planning action items for the week: demultiplexing data, denoising, clustering, etc.
*Figure out how to distribute tasks


Meeting minutes
- Data Wrangling (ignore dataset overview)
- Subset Halverson: 20 people to 20 IBD to match paper 4: 19 patients and 19 donors

**- Merge afterwards
**
To do:
- Read through the proposal outline
- Wrangle

- Columns:
- Keep diseases as IBD, 

- Paper 4:
- healthy-control, IBD-no_FMT, IBD_FMT-short, IBD_FMT-long


- Halverson: only 
- healthy-control, IBD_no_surgery, IBD_surgery

- Healthy 20 people
- IBD surgery of 3-month time point, 


Subset in the duplier package

Manifest: has sample-id and absolute-file path; in R filter the manifest based off the metadata


**Oct 15 Agenda** 
1. Updates on data-wrangling
2. Discuss Halfvarson (short vs long time points, how we want to subset)
3. Proposal discussion - how to split tasks
- Replace section 8 with the new section
- Use an "ing" word in title -> "comparing" how X and X
- Intro and background: IBD background, explain signficance of research
- Objective: broader question and hypothesis; hypothesis must include a biological rationale
- Experimental aims: 1. wrangling (so categories are can be compared); 
- Approach: analyses
- Data wrangling instead of 

**Halfvarson**: Subsetting numbers
- Healthy-control: n = 9
- IBD_no_surg: n = 19
- IBD_surg_short (timepoint 1): n = 19
- IBD_surg_long (timepoint 2): n = 19

Proposal:

Title: 
- Intro and Background: Victoria and Georgia
- Research Objectives: Alex
- Experimental aims: Lester
- Approach: Sid
- Flowchart: Sid
- Weekly timeframe (Gantt Chart): Alex and Lester
- Data Wrangling: all
- Particpation Report: all

**Finish individual parts by Friday**

Oct 22nd 
- give updates on data processing
- go over what needs to be done in the next week
